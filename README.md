This case will hold all the CRAP for your 3D printer or CNC.  Whether
your CRAP is a Controller, RAMPS, Arduino and Power, or a Controller,
RAMBo, And Power, it will hold your CRAP.

The goal as to create a case that could be printed on any 3D printer with
a 6"x6" print bed, but also have the option to cut larger panels if you
have a CNC router, or other tools to do it with. I plan to keep the overall
dimensions of this case the same even as I make changes to the way it is
built.  The goal is that others can design mounts and panels that will
fit the case, and they will be compatible no matter how the build process
changes.

I've had some delays getting my first prototype printed and assembled, but
it's finally getting there.  There are a couple things I have noticed that
may need to be changed.

* When the panels are screwed on, it helps to hold the frame together, except
for the back frame piece.  Right now, it is only held on by the pegs sticking
into it.

* If you use small panels, it does not help to keep the frame together.  I am
not sure there is a good solution to this.

* The front angled frames and bottom frames that are under them are currently
two pieces.  I originally had them as once piece, but thought the front screws
that hold the bottom panel in place might be hard to get a screw into, and may
need to be done before the board beams (I need better terms) and front frames
are pushed in place.  I screwed them in after everything else was assembled
though, and it wasn't difficult.  I may go back to having them as a single piece.
